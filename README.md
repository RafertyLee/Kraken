While Deep Space Krakens are randomly popping up at your journey to Duna and ruining your great day, come and check out **Project Kraken**!

## About Kraken

**Project Kraken** is a <u>dynamic linked libary</u> project based on kRPC C++ Lib. It aims to provide players with easy access to complex operations such as automatic ascending, landing and docking as well as detailed tutorials about **Project Kraken**. 

## Our philosophy

- **Programming**: Many KSP players enjoys watching their neat and tidy computer programs automatically controls their rockets lifting off. We aim to enhance the enjoyment by providing players with easy access to complex and advanced controlling method.
- **Gaming**: Lots of repeated operations exists in KSP, which is kinda boring when you need to launch numerous same vehicles to complete a mission or contract. We aim to reduce or eliminate such operations, thus boosting gaming experience.
- **Guidance**: kRPC lack of advanced examples, leading to that players need to spend desent amount of time "exploring" kRPC. We aim to provice tutorial and examples for players to quick get the hang of **Project Kraken**.
- **Visualization**: Vessel controlling is ABSTRACT. We aim to provide players with intuitive graphs and 3d animations that we may also see at real-world mission control centers. 

## Our Goals

1. **Interop Functionality**: communicate with kRPC mod running in a KSP instance.

2. **API**: query and pack in-game information for user access, eg. vehicle position and velocity, reference frame, similar to what kRPC API does.

3. **Modules**: provide modules ranging from physical calculation and approximation to automatic controlling, with all modules designed to be highly modular and easy-to-use.

4. **Documentations and Examples**: create detailed documentation and examples for players' reference.

5. **Visualizations**: create visualization tools, brining abstract operations into intuitive graphs.
